Docker Cluster = Swarm (tool provided by docker)

condition:
  Suppose when we have single host on which container multiple are running
    challanges faced :-
      - 1 Limited resources , if want to increase the resource then we have to do vertical scaling
      - 2 Down-Time
      - 3 SPOF(single point of failure)
    
  when we are having the multiple hosts on which multiple containers are running , 
    here we are doing the horizonal scaling (multiples hosts, eg., A(worker node), B(worker node) ...
    for managing this worker nodes we required the manager or master node
  when all this woring together to achieve one task, this team technically known as cluster (ther are managing container caleed as container cluster)
   for cerating any cluster we requried software(tool) their are various tools available in market (cluster management tool)
    one of the famous tool is Kubernetes, swarm
  here we are learning swarm , swarm is a tool come from docker ,, kubernetes is a third parthy management tool

**************************************************************************************************************************************
Creating the Swarm Cluster
  1. Manager/ master node
  2. multiple slave node


Initalinsizing a swarm in master/ manager node # docker swarm init -h
    # docker swarm init --advertise-addr (master IP)     // ater running this command it automatically become master node
    # docker node ls

after this the master/manager will give you command (# docker swarm join --tok.........) copy this command and paste in worker node 
that's set == horizonta scaling

#docker info,#docker node ls


for lauching container in swarm :
    # docker service ls 
    # docker service create --name webserver httpd
    # docker service ps webserver

Swarm Replication

 Condition:
    when you hve run your website in a conainer suppose cantainer has capability to handle 100 clents,
    if 101 clients comes than webside goes down here the concep come of replica it will launch exactly same copy of container
    this is also called the horizontal scaling they creating muitple replicas
      from swarm prespective container is a TASK
      for Docker prespective it is a container and 
      for realastic prespective it is a process

Load Balancing: 
    - A load balancer is aa device in betn client and servers ensuring that all resource servers are used equally.
    - swarm will give you pre creaded load balancing (PRE SETUP LOAD BALANCER)  
    - whenever you want to launch a task swarm will always launch a one service for you i.e., almost equal to load balancer
  - by default service is isolated to expose it in to outside world have use port
      # docker service create --name myweb  --publish 8080:80 httpd

pratical: 
31-2-3    # docker service create --name myweb --publish 8080:80 vimal10/apache-webserver-php 
        // using this image eew will get to know on whch cantainer our webside is running


          # docker service scale myweb=5
          Adding scale out
          Decreasing Sacale In
Tis Concep technically known as Orcherstration (managing container here and there is known as orcherestraon )
