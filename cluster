Docker Cluster = Swarm (tool provided by docker)

condition:
  Suppose when we have single host on which container multiple are running
    challanges faced :-
      - 1 Limited resources , if want to increase the resource then we have to do vertical scaling
      - 2 Down-Time
      - 3 SPOF(single point of failure)
    
  when we are having the multiple hosts on which multiple containers are running , 
    here we are doing the horizonal scaling (multiples hosts, eg., A(worker node), B(worker node) ...
    for managing this worker nodes we required the manager or master node
  when all this woring together to achieve one task, this team technically known as cluster (ther are managing container caleed as container cluster)
