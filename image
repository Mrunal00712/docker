whatever your image(cenos) conatains will reflect to your container 
eg., date cmd, ifconfig command etc.

Benefits-
    - you can set up your own custom container in image
    - we can't share the containr but can share the image
    - whatever set-up i do in a container i can share with others by creating the image
    - you can clone your container into an image

Their are two ways to create a custom image = @1 commit, @2code

1. Commit
    # docker commit (container name ) (your owm image name and version) 
eg., # docker commit myos1 lwimage:v1        //you can create yur own image & using that image you can also launch the container

    # docker run -it lwimage:v1
*(* we mostly dont use commit cammand because it dose not provide much facility 


2. Code (Docker File)

FROM centos:7    //with the help of from keyword you are telling to the code that you have to create a image base image i want to use from centos
