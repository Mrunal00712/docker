typing commands to perform certain task (like 3 tier architecture) :- Manuly (make process slow), wihout devops (technoloy, principle(other thisng is automation)) you will nat abel to surview the world 

  with he help of Docker Compose we will automate the things by writhing the code(yaml code)

  documentation: docs.docker.com/compose/
  
  Install the software docker compose
  install compose standalone :- https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/other/#install-compose-standalone
# curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.23.3/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

to make command execuatable we need to run one command "chmod" in linux

  # chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

  // check properly runnin or not
  # docker-compose version // commands run succsefully no error comes up
  Architecture
                Compose
              Docker - Engine
                  O.S

  docker compose will help you in a automation world in automation you will always write a code
*****************docker-compose Installed *************************************************
  create a workspace for storing yaml file

mycode.yml file
  version: "3.8"         ///good practice to write // chech version at :- docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/
  services: 
    c1:
      container_name: "myos1"
      image: "ubuntu:14.04"
      command: "cal"

    c2:
      container_name: "myos2"
      image: "centos:7"
      command: "cal"
  # docker-compose -f mycode.yml up
  # docker-compose -f mycode.yml ps     //  this command will teel you by above cammand what we launch the two cantainer
  # mv mycode.yml docker-compose.yml    // mv cammand used to rename file
  by deafualt file for docker compose is "docker-compose.yml"
  # docker-compose logs (container name)
  #docker-compose stop
